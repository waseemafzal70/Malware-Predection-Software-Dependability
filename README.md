# Malware-Predection-Software-Dependability
In this project, we used the CTU-13 datasets to train Random Forest clas- sifier models capable of classifying
IP addresses that belong to a botnet. A Random Forest Classifier (Scikit-Learn package) was the best model
for cor- rectly classifying malicious IP addresses in the test dataset, with an accuracy of 95source bytes, and
total bytes of a bidirectional net flow were the most essential elements in categorizing malicious IP addresses
using feature importance, per- mutation importance, and SHAP model explanation approaches. Malicious
gamers used UDP (User Datagram Protocol) the most of any protocol, with traffic originating from UDP
boosting the possibility that a specific net flow belongs to them.
